# Rx / MVVM / Firebase Sample Application

ToDo App which aims to use as much Rx in layers as possible.  This might actually be slightly
overusing Rx.  Really a matter of opinion.  The point of this app is to be used as a learning tool
to help show how Rx works and to spark thinking in FP for those unfamiliar with the paradigm.

## Note:

You must go set up your own Firebase project / app and add your own google-services.json file into
the app module.
